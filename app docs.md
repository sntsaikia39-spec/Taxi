## 1. Business Requirements Document (BRD)

### 1.1 Business Overview

**Rina's Tours and Travels** is a taxi and tour operator serving Itanagar and the wider Papum Pare / Lower Subansiri region of Arunachal Pradesh, India. Its services centre on **Donyi Polo Airport (Hollongi)** — the only commercial airport serving the state capital — and on guided tourism across Arunachal Pradesh.

The business offers three product lines:

| Line | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Airport taxi** | Point-to-point transfers between Donyi Polo Airport (Hollongi) and destinations such as Itanagar, Naharlagun, Ziro, Bomdila, Tawang, etc. Distance-based pricing. |
| **Tour packages** | Fixed-price curated multi-hour / multi-day tours with a predefined itinerary, vehicle, and passenger cap. |
| **Hourly taxi** | Time-based ("disposal") taxi hire within and around Itanagar — billed per hour or per day. |

The digital platform — **Rina's Tours and Travels (RT&T)** — provides a customer-facing booking website and an internal operations dashboard.


### 1.2 Business Objectives

| # | Objective | How the platform delivers it |
|---|-----------|------------------------------|
| O1 | Digitise booking & payment end to end | Self-service web booking + Razorpay online payments |
| O2 | Reduce missed bookings | 24/7 self-service, no phone dependency |
| O3 | Centralise operations | Single admin dashboard for bookings, fleet, pricing, tours |
| O4 | Track every rupee | `payments` + `payment_records` tables; PDF invoices |
| O5 | Eliminate double-bookings | Conflict control system with overlap detection |
| O6 | Notify customers & drivers automatically | Resend transactional emails |
| O7 | Provide operational visibility | Analytics tab: revenue, fleet utilization, top routes/tours |

### 1.3 Business Rules

These rules are enforced by the system and must be preserved by any future change:

| ID | Rule |
|----|------|
| BR-01 | Every booking is identified by a unique `booking_id` of the form `BK` + timestamp-based suffix (see [`generateBookingId`](#76-utility-functions)). |
| BR-02 | A booking cannot be created without an authenticated user account. |
| BR-03 | **Partial payment** = exactly **30%** of the total paid online via Razorpay; the remaining **70%** is collected in cash by the driver. **Full payment** = **100%** online. |
| BR-04 | The 30% advance is computed as `Math.round(total × 0.30 × 100) / 100`; the cash portion is `total − advance` (avoids floating-point drift). |
| BR-05 | A booking is only marked `confirmed` after the Razorpay payment **signature is verified server-side** (HMAC-SHA256). |
| BR-06 | A customer may cancel a booking only if the trip start is **more than 24 hours away** (see [`canCancelBooking`](#76-utility-functions)). Admins may cancel at any time. |
| BR-07 | When **conflict control is ON**, a vehicle/model cannot be committed for a time window that overlaps an existing assignment. Overlap = `existing.start < new.end AND existing.end > new.start`. |
| BR-08 | Bookings left in `pending` (unpaid) for more than 24 hours are deleted automatically by a daily cron job. |
| BR-09 | A user may submit **at most one review per item** (`UNIQUE(user_email, reviewable_type, reviewable_id)`). |
| BR-10 | Ratings are integers from **1 to 5** (DB `CHECK` constraint). |
| BR-11 | Tour bookings cannot exceed the tour's `max_passengers`; airport/hourly bookings cannot exceed the chosen car model's `capacity`. |
| BR-12 | All monetary amounts are stored and processed in **INR**. Razorpay amounts are expressed in **paise** (× 100). |
| BR-13 | Customers see car **models** (name, class, capacity, price, available count) — never number plates, driver names, or specific car IDs — until after a vehicle is assigned by an admin. |

### 1.4 Stakeholders

| Stakeholder | Role | Primary needs |
|-------------|------|---------------|
| **Customer** | Books and pays for trips | Fast booking, transparent pricing, receipts, booking history, cancellation |
| **Admin / Operator** | Runs day-to-day operations | Booking management, vehicle & driver assignment, cash reconciliation, content CRUD, analytics |
| **Driver** | Executes the trip | Email notification of assignments with customer contact and trip details |
| **Developer** | Maintains and extends the platform | Clean API, typed code, reproducible setup |

### 1.5 Revenue Model

The platform itself charges no commission — it is an owned channel. Revenue is the trip fare:

- **Airport taxi:** `distance_km × cars.per_km_charge` for the chosen car class; distance is stored per destination row (all distances measured FROM Hollongi Airport).
- **Hourly taxi:** `no_of_hours × cars.per_hr_charge` for the chosen car class.
- **Tours:** fixed `price` per `tour_packages` row, independent of distance.

Cash collected at the airport (the 70% balance on partial bookings) is reconciled in the admin dashboard by marking the cash as collected, which records the collector's name and timestamp.

### 1.6 Constraints

- **Vercel Hobby** deployment: serverless functions have a ~10 s execution limit; bundle and execution budgets apply.
- **Supabase** free tier: 500 MB DB, 2 GB egress / month.
- **Razorpay**: India-only, INR only, minimum ₹1.
- **Region**: Vercel functions run from `iad1` (US East); database latency to India is acceptable for this workload.
- No native server-side rendering for user-specific pages — those are client-rendered against the Supabase client.

### 1.7 Risk Register

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Razorpay outage | Customers can't pay online | Partial-payment mode still allows trips; cash fallback handled offline |
| Supabase free-tier limits hit | Read/write failures | Monitor usage; upgrade tier; archive old bookings |
| Stale `pending` bookings | Clutter, false conflicts | Daily `cleanup-pending` cron |
| Admin credential leak | Full operational compromise | bcrypt hashing, JWT expiry (24 h), change default password, planned 2FA & rate limiting |
| Vercel function timeout on heavy queries | 504 errors | Keep queries indexed and narrow; paginate admin lists |

## 2. Product Requirements Document (PRD)

### 2.1 Product Vision

A mobile-first web application that lets travellers in Arunachal Pradesh book airport taxis, hourly taxis, and curated tours from Rina's Tours and Travels in under two minutes — and gives the operator a single dashboard to run the entire business.

### 2.2 User Personas

**Persona A — "Arriving Traveller" (primary)**
- Lands at Donyi Polo Airport, needs a taxi to Itanagar/Naharlagun or onward.
- On a phone, possibly on weak network, wants a quick confirmed price and a driver assigned.
- Values: speed, transparent fare, a confirmation they can show.

**Persona B — "Trip Planner / Tourist"**
- Planning an Arunachal trip weeks ahead; comparing tour packages.
- Wants itinerary detail, photos, reviews, and the ability to lock a date with a small advance.
- Values: information depth, social proof (reviews), flexible 30% advance.

**Persona C — "Local Resident"**
- Needs a car for a few hours / a day within Itanagar (errands, events).
- Wants simple hourly pricing and a known vehicle class.
- Values: simplicity, predictable per-hour cost.

**Persona D — "Operator / Admin"**
- Runs Rina's Tours; non-technical but comfortable with web apps.
- Needs to see today's bookings, assign cars & drivers, confirm cash, manage prices and tours, and see how the business is doing.
- Values: clarity, few clicks, no surprises, mobile-usable dashboard.

### 2.3 Core Features & User Stories

Each feature lists representative user stories with acceptance criteria (AC).

#### F-01 — User Authentication
- *As a new customer, I want to sign up with email & password so I can book trips.*
  - AC: Email format validated (RFC 5322 simplified); password 6–128 chars; full name ≥ 2 words, letters/spaces/hyphens/apostrophes only; verification email sent on signup; login blocked until verified.
- *As a returning customer, I want to log in with email & password.*
  - AC: Verified email + correct password logs in; session persists across tabs; unverified email blocked with a resend-verification nudge.
- *As a new or returning customer, I want to sign up or log in with Google so I can skip email/password entry.*
  - AC: "Continue with Google" button on both `/login` and `/signup`; clicking it initiates Google OAuth; after Google consent the user is routed back through `/auth/callback` → `/auth/verify`; session is set and the user lands on `/bookings` (or the page they were trying to reach); no email verification step required — Google guarantees a verified email.
- *As a customer, I want to change my password.*
  - AC: `/change` page updates the password through Supabase Auth.
- *As a customer who verified on a different device, I want to land logged-in.*
  - AC: Clicking the verification link exchanges the code for a session and redirects authenticated.

#### F-02 — Airport Taxi Booking
- *As an arriving traveller, I want to book a taxi from the airport to my destination for a date & time.*
  - AC: 5-step flow — **Contact → Route → Date & Time → Car → Confirm**; destinations come from the `destinations` table (each with `distance_km`, `estimated_duration_minutes`); only car models with ≥ 1 free unit for the window are shown; fare breakdown shown before confirm; passenger count ≤ chosen model `capacity`.

#### F-03 — Hourly Taxi Booking
- *As a customer, I want to hire a car for N hours/days within Itanagar.*
  - AC: 5-step flow — **Contact → Passengers & Date → Time & Duration → Car → Confirm**; duration entered as days + hours; price = per-hour/per-day rate × duration; availability checked over the full window.

#### F-04 — Tour Package Booking
- *As a tourist, I want to browse tours and book one for a date.*
  - AC: Tour list and category landing pages (`/arunachal-tours`, `/itanagar-tours`); tour detail page shows description, itinerary, highlights, multi-image gallery, average rating & reviews; booking checks availability and `max_passengers`; price is fixed per tour.

#### F-05 — Payment Processing
- *As a customer, I want to pay 30% now and 70% cash to the driver, or pay 100% now.*
  - AC: Two buttons — **Partial (30% online)** and **Full (100% online)**; Razorpay checkout (company shown as "Rina's Tours and Travels"); server creates the Razorpay order, then verifies the signature on callback; on success the booking becomes `confirmed`, a payment record is written, an invoice number is generated, and a confirmation email is sent.

#### F-06 — Invoice
- *As a customer, I want to download a PDF invoice for my booking.*
  - AC: PDF generated client-side (jsPDF) with company header, booking ID, customer & trip details, and payment breakdown (online paid / cash due / total); available from "Booking Confirmed" and "My Bookings".

#### F-07 — My Bookings & Cancellation
- *As a customer, I want to see all my bookings with status and continue paying for pending ones.*
  - AC: `/bookings` lists bookings by email with status badges; pending bookings have a "Continue to Pay" action; "Cancel" available only > 24 h before trip start; cancellation creates a request the admin processes.

#### F-08 — Reviews & Ratings
- *As a customer, I want to rate a completed trip/tour 1–5 stars with a title & comment.*
  - AC: One review per user per item; rating 1–5; review appears on tour pages; admins can hide a review.

#### F-09 — Admin Dashboard
- *As an admin, I want to manage everything from one place.*
  - AC: Tabs — **Overview, Bookings, Cars, Destinations, Tours, Analytics, Misc**; JWT-protected; mobile responsive; dark mode toggle. See [§12](#12-admin-dashboard-reference).

#### F-10 — Email Notifications
- *As a customer, I want a confirmation email; as a driver, I want an assignment email.*
  - AC: Booking confirmation on payment verified; driver notification on vehicle assignment; cancellation email on cancellation processed; delivered via Resend (SMTP fallback available).

#### F-11 — Conflict Control
- *As an admin, I want the system to prevent double-booking a vehicle — but I want to be able to turn it off.*
  - AC: `app_settings.conflict_control_enabled` toggle; when ON, overlapping assignments are blocked; when OFF, the admin manages conflicts manually and can view detected conflicts in the Misc tab.

#### F-12 — SEO Landing Pages
- *As the business, I want dedicated pages to rank for local search.*
  - AC: Static-content pages: `/hollongi-airport-taxi`, `/donyi-polo-airport-taxi`, `/itanagar-airport-taxi`, `/hourly-taxi-itanagar`, `/arunachal-tours`, `/itanagar-tours`; semantic HTML + Next.js metadata; legacy `/airport-taxi-itanagar` permanently redirects to `/itanagar-airport-taxi`.

### 2.4 Out of Scope (Current Version)

Real-time GPS driver tracking · driver mobile app · SMS / WhatsApp delivery (placeholders only) · automated refunds (manual admin step) · multi-language UI · in-app support chat · loyalty / promo codes · third-party error tracking (Sentry) — all tracked in [§14.12 TODOs](#1412-outstanding-todos).

## 4. System Architecture Document (SAD)

### 4.1 Architecture Style

A **monolithic full-stack web application** on **Next.js 14 (App Router)**, deployed as static assets + serverless functions on **Vercel**, backed by **Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth)**, with two external integrations: **Razorpay** (payments) and **Resend** (email). It is conceptually a **three-tier architecture**: presentation (React pages), application (API route handlers + `lib/`), data (Supabase).

### 4.4 Security Architecture

| Concern | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| Customer auth | Supabase session (managed cookies) via `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs` |
| Admin auth | `admins.password_hash` (bcrypt) → `jwt.sign({id,email,role}, JWT_SECRET, {expiresIn:'24h'})` → `localStorage.adminToken` |
| Admin route guard | Each `/api/admin/*` handler calls `jwt.verify(token, JWT_SECRET)` before any work; admin pages wrapped in `ProtectedAdminPage` |
| Secret handling | `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET`, `JWT_SECRET`, `RESEND_API_KEY` are server-only env vars; only `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` reach the browser (`next.config.js` `env` block) |
| Payment integrity | Razorpay hosted checkout; server verifies `HMAC-SHA256(order_id\|payment_id, secret)` against the returned signature |
| RLS | Customer-facing reads use the anon-key client (`lib/supabase.ts`) under Row Level Security; privileged writes use the service-role client (`lib/supabase-admin.ts`) which bypasses RLS — used **server-side only** |
| HTTP headers | Set globally in `next.config.js` (see NFR-07) |
| Input validation | `lib/validation.ts` on every user-supplied string |

## 5. High-Level Design (HLD)

### 5.1 System Modules

| Module | Responsibility | Key files |

## 6. Low-Level Design (LLD)

### 6.1 Authentication Flows

**Customer signup (email + password)**
```
Client → supabase.auth.signUp({ email, password, options: { data: { full_name }, emailRedirectTo: origin/auth/callback } })
        → Supabase emails a verification link
User clicks link → GET /auth/callback?code=<code>
        → server redirects to /auth/verify?code=<code>&redirect=/bookings
        → /auth/verify calls POST /api/auth/exchange-code { code }
        → server: supabase.auth.exchangeCodeForSession(code)  → session tokens returned
        → client sets session cookies; redirect to /bookings (authenticated)
```

**Customer login (email + password)**
```
supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({ email, password })
   ↳ blocked by Supabase if email not yet verified → "verify your email" nudge shown with resend option
   ↳ session persisted; AuthContext exposes { user, isLoading, signOut, ... }
```

**Customer signup or login (Google OAuth)**
```
User clicks "Continue with Google" on /login or /signup
   → signInWithOAuth('google', redirect) in AuthContext
   → supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth({ provider: 'google', options: { redirectTo: origin/auth/callback?redirect=<redirect> } })
   → Browser redirected to Google consent screen
   → Google redirects back to GET /auth/callback?code=<code>&redirect=<redirect>
   → server redirects to /auth/verify?code=<code>&redirect=<redirect>
   → /auth/verify calls POST /api/auth/exchange-code { code }
   → server: supabase.auth.exchangeCodeForSession(code)  → session tokens returned
   → client sets session cookies; redirect to <redirect> (defaults to /bookings)

Note: no email verification step — Google guarantees a verified email.
      /auth/callback → /auth/verify → POST /api/auth/exchange-code is the
      shared pipeline for both email verification and Google OAuth.
```

**Admin login & guard**
```
POST /api/admin/login { email, password }
   SELECT * FROM admins WHERE email = ? AND is_active = true
   bcrypt.compare(password, row.password_hash)  → must be true
   token = jwt.sign({ id, email, role }, JWT_SECRET, { expiresIn: '24h' })
   UPDATE admins SET last_login = now() WHERE id = row.id
   → { token, admin: { email, fullName, role } }
Client: localStorage.setItem('adminToken', token); AdminContext holds state

Every protected request: header  Authorization: Bearer <token>
   jwt.verify(token, JWT_SECRET) → { id, email, role }  (else 401)
```

### 6.2 Booking Creation

```
POST /api/bookings/create
Input (varies by type):
  booking_type ∈ { 'airport', 'tour', 'hourly' }
  user_name, user_email, phone, passenger_count
  start_datetime, end_datetime
  destination_id?      (airport)
  tour_package_id?     (tour)
  no_of_hours?         (hourly)
  car_model, amount_total

Steps:
  1. booking_id = generateBookingId()                    // "BK" + timestamp suffix
  2. read conflict_control_enabled from app_settings
  3. if enabled: check overlap against vehicle_assignments / committed bookings
        overlap ⇔ existing.start < new.end AND existing.end > new.start
        → if overlap, 409 Conflict
  4. INSERT INTO bookings (... , booking_status = 'pending')
  5. → { success: true, booking_id }
```

The booking UI is a guided multi-step wizard. There are two wizard implementations:

**Taxi wizard** (`app/book-taxi/page.tsx`) — covers Airport and Hourly types:
- **Airport** steps: `contact → destination/passengers → date/time → car → confirm`
- **Hourly** steps: `contact → date/passengers → time/duration → car → confirm`

Each step component is memoised; refs preserve focus across re-renders; the `ContactStep` locks the email field when the user is already authenticated.

**Tour wizard** (`app/tours/[id]/book/page.tsx`) — dedicated per-package page:
- **Steps:** `contact → passengers → date → confirm`
- Authentication is enforced upfront: unauthenticated users are redirected to `/login?redirect=/tours/[id]/book` before the wizard renders.
- The email field is locked and pre-filled from the authenticated user's session; full name is pre-filled from `user_metadata.full_name` if available.
- Car model is **preset by the tour package** — the user does not choose a vehicle.
- Fare is `tour.price × passengers`; the confirm step offers full payment or **30% advance** (`Math.round(totalPrice × 0.3)`).
- On the date step, `GET /api/tours/[id]/availability?booking_date=` is called; if the tour's car model is fully booked for that date the user sees an advisory warning but can still proceed.
- On confirm, `booking_id` is generated client-side (`generateBookingId()`), the payload is sent to `POST /api/bookings/create` with `booking_type: 'tour'` and `tour_package_id`, the result is stored in `sessionStorage` as `tourBookingData`, and the user is redirected to `/payment?bookingId=...&type=tour&amount=<advancePayment>`.

### 6.3 Payment Processing

**Phase 1 — create order** (`POST /api/payment/create-order`)
```
Input: { amount, bookingId, currency: 'INR' }
  razorpay.orders.create({ amount: round(amount*100), currency: 'INR', receipt: bookingId })
  INSERT/UPSERT payments { booking_id, payment_type, amount_total,
                           amount_online_paid = amount, amount_cash_paid,
                           txn_status: 'pending', gateway: 'razorpay', payment_status: 'pending' }
  → { orderId }
```

**Phase 2 — browser checkout**
```
Razorpay modal opens with { key: NEXT_PUBLIC_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID, amount: round(amount*100),
                            currency: 'INR', name: "Rina's Tours and Travels", order_id: orderId }
On success Razorpay returns { razorpay_order_id, razorpay_payment_id, razorpay_signature }
```

**Phase 3 — verify & confirm** (`POST /api/payment/verify`)
```
Input: { orderId, paymentId, signature, bookingId, amount, paymentType, userEmail, userName, ... }
  expected = HMAC_SHA256(orderId + "|" + paymentId, RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET)
  if expected !== signature → 400 "Invalid payment signature"
  UPDATE payments SET txn_status='success', txn_id=paymentId,
                      payment_status = (paymentType==='partial' ? 'partial' : 'paid')
  UPDATE bookings SET booking_status='confirmed'
  invoice_number = generateInvoiceNumber()
  INSERT payment_records { payment_id, booking_id, txn_type:'online', txn_id, gateway:'razorpay',
                           amount, currency:'INR', status:'success', razorpay_order_id, invoice_number }
  sendBookingConfirmation({ to: userEmail, ... })   // via Resend
  → { success: true, bookingId, invoiceNumber }
```

**Cash collection** (`POST /api/payment/confirm-cash`, admin) — sets `amount_cash_paid`, `cash_paid_at`, `cash_collected_by`; helper `markCashPaymentCollected()` in `lib/payment-db.ts`.

**Payment-amount math** (`lib/payment-utils.ts`, client-safe):
```ts
calculatePaymentAmounts(total, 'full')    // { amountOnlinePaid: total,        amountCashPaid: 0 }
calculatePaymentAmounts(total, 'partial') // online = round(total*0.3*100)/100; cash = round((total-online)*100)/100
validatePaymentAmounts('full',   total, online) // |online - total| < 0.01
validatePaymentAmounts('partial',total, online) // |online - round(total*0.3*100)/100| < 0.01
```

### 6.4 Vehicle Availability Algorithm

```
GET /api/cars/available-models?booking_date=YYYY-MM-DD&start_time=HH:MM&end_time=HH:MM

reqStart = combine(booking_date, start_time)
reqEnd   = combine(booking_date, end_time)

allCars       = SELECT * FROM cars WHERE is_active = true
occupiedCarIds = SELECT car_id FROM vehicle_assignments
                 WHERE start_datetime < reqEnd AND end_datetime > reqStart   -- overlap

availableCars = allCars where id ∉ occupiedCarIds
models        = group availableCars by model_name → for each:
                { model_name, class, capacity, per_km_charge, per_hr_charge,
                  available_count = count of free units of that model }
→ { models }
```

Users only ever see the **model-level** projection. The number plate, driver, and specific `car_id` are revealed only after an admin assigns a vehicle via `POST /api/bookings/assign-vehicle`.

### 6.5 Conflict Control System

- Stored as `app_settings.conflict_control_enabled` (text `'true'`/`'false'`, default `'true'`).
- **ON** — `POST /api/bookings/create` and `assign-vehicle` reject overlapping commitments.
- **OFF** — no automatic blocking; the admin manages conflicts manually. The Misc tab's **conflict scanner** (`GET /api/admin/conflicts`) reports two classes:
  - **Assignment conflicts** — the *same specific car* committed to overlapping windows.
  - **Model conflicts** — more bookings of a model than there are units of that model in an overlapping window (over-subscription), which can arise in tour flows.
- Toggle via `POST /api/admin/settings { key:'conflict_control_enabled', value:'true'|'false' }`. Turning it OFF shows a warning modal first.

### 6.6 Invoice Generation

`lib/invoice.ts` builds a PDF entirely client-side (jsPDF, with html2canvas for any rendered fragments):

```
InvoiceData {
  invoiceNumber, bookingId,
  customerName, customerEmail, customerPhone,
  serviceType,                      // "Airport Taxi" | "Tour Package" | "Hourly Taxi"
  bookingDate, pickupTime,
  vehicleModel, passengers,
  amountTotal, amountOnlinePaid, amountCashDue,
  paymentType                       // 'partial' | 'full'
}
```
Layout: company header ("Rina's Tours and Travels") · invoice meta (number, date, booking ID) · customer block · service block · payment-breakdown table (online paid / cash due / total) · footer/terms. Triggered from the Booking Confirmed page and from My Bookings.

### 6.7 Stale-Booking Cleanup

`POST /api/admin/cleanup-pending` (called by Vercel Cron `0 0 * * *`) deletes bookings where `booking_status = 'pending'` and `created_at < now() − 24h`. The cleanup window is configurable from the Misc tab (1–30 days) and the auto-cleanup can be toggled off; a manual "run now" button is also provided.

## 7. Technical Design Document (TDD)

### 7.1 Frontend Architecture

**State strategy**

| State | Mechanism | Examples |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| Customer auth | `AuthContext` (Supabase session) | `user`, `isLoading`, `signInWithEmail`, `signUpWithEmail`, `signInWithOAuth`, `resendVerificationEmail`, `signOut` |
| Admin session | `AdminContext` (JWT in `localStorage`) | `isAdmin`, `adminEmail`, `adminFullName`, `isLoading`, `login`, `logout`, `updateAdminProfile` |
| Cross-page handoff | `sessionStorage` | `bookingData` / `tourBookingData` passed from booking flow to `/payment` |
| Global UI | Zustand | misc shared UI flags |
| Local | `useState` / `useRef` | wizard step, form fields, modals; refs keep focus across re-renders |

**Page-render strategy**

| Page(s) | Strategy | Reason |
|---------|----------|--------|
| `/` | CSR | Heavy GSAP/Lottie animation, interactive |
| `/book-taxi`, `/tours/[id]/book`, `/payment`, `/bookings`, `/booking-confirmed` | CSR | Dynamic, auth-dependent, talk to Supabase client |
| `/tours`, `/tours/[id]/reviews` | CSR | Live data + reviews |
| `/admin`, `/admin/docs` | CSR | Protected, real-time, no SEO need |
| SEO pages (`*-airport-taxi`, `*-tours`) | Static content | Optimised for organic search |

**Root layout** (`app/layout.tsx`): `AuthContext.Provider → AdminContext.Provider → AppSplashLoader → RouteScrollUnlocker → Header → {page} → Footer`. `SmoothScrollWrapper` wraps animated pages.

### 7.2 API Design Conventions

- Handlers live in `app/api/**/route.ts` (App Router Route Handlers).
- Response envelope: `{ success: boolean, ...data }` or `{ success: false, error: string }`. Some read endpoints return a named collection (e.g. `{ bookings: [...] }`, `{ models: [...] }`).
- HTTP codes used per semantics: `200`, `201`, `400`, `401`, `403`, `404`, `409`, `500`.
- Admin routes verify `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>` first.
- Supabase client choice: anon (`lib/supabase.ts`) for customer reads under RLS; service-role (`lib/supabase-admin.ts`) for privileged server-side writes (the admin client is module-cached to survive Vercel warm starts).

### 7.3 Database Client Usage Matrix

| Operation | Client | Library |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Customer reads own bookings | anon (RLS) | `lib/db.ts` (`fetchBookingsByEmail`, `fetchBookingById`) |
| Create / update bookings (server) | service role | `lib/db.ts` (`createBooking`, `updateBooking`, `updateBookingPaymentStatus`) |
| Payment writes | service role | `lib/payment-db.ts` (`createPaymentInDB`, `getPaymentByBookingId`, `updatePaymentStatus`, `createPaymentRecord`, `getPaymentRecordsByPaymentId`, `markCashPaymentCollected`) |
| Tours / destinations / pricing CRUD | service role | `lib/database.ts` |
| Tour fetch + rating stats (customer) | anon | `lib/db.ts` (`fetchAllTours`, `fetchTourById`, `fetchAllTourRatingStats`), `lib/reviews.ts` |
| Auth | Supabase Auth SDK | `lib/supabase.ts` |
| Admin auth (admins table) | service role | direct in `app/api/admin/login` |

### 7.4 Email Notification System

Primary: **Resend** (`lib/resend-notifications.ts`). Fallback: **SMTP via Nodemailer** (`lib/notifications.ts`).

| Trigger | Recipient | Content |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| Payment verified | Customer | Booking confirmation: booking ID, invoice number, trip details, payment breakdown |
| Vehicle assigned / reassigned | Driver | Assignment: booking details + customer name & phone |
| Cancellation processed | Customer | Cancellation confirmation + refund notes if any |

SMS / WhatsApp are placeholders only (currently console-logged).

### 7.5 Cron Jobs

| Job | Schedule (`vercel.json`) | Endpoint | Action |
|-----|--------------------------|----------|--------|
| Cleanup stale pending bookings | `0 0 * * *` (daily 00:00 UTC) | `POST /api/admin/cleanup-pending` | Delete `pending` bookings older than the configured window (default 24 h) |

### 7.6 Utility Functions

`lib/utils.ts`:
| Function | Signature | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| `formatCurrency` | `(amount: number, currency = 'INR') => string` | e.g. `₹1,500.00` |
| `formatDate` | `(date: string \| Date) => string` | e.g. `21 Apr 2026` |
| `formatDateTime` | `(date: string \| Date) => string` | date + time |
| `formatTime` | `(time: string) => string` | e.g. `10:30 AM` |
| `validateEmail` / `validatePhoneNumber` / `validateName` | `(v: string) => boolean` | quick boolean checks (stricter checks live in `lib/validation.ts`) |
| `calculateAdvancePayment` | `(total: number) => number` | 30% of total |
| `calculateRemainingPayment` | `(total: number) => number` | 70% of total |
| `calculateTotalPrice` | `(basePrice: number, hours?: number, days?: number) => number` | hourly/daily totals |
| `generateBookingId` | `() => string` | `BK` + timestamp suffix |
| `generateInvoiceNumber` | `() => string` | sequential-style invoice number |
| `canCancelBooking` | `(bookingDate: string) => boolean` | true if > 24 h before trip |
| `getBookingStatus` | `(status: string) => { label, color, icon }` | UI badge meta |
| `getPaymentStatusBadge` | `(status: string) => { label, color }` | UI badge meta |
| `truncateString` / `capitalizeFirstLetter` / `toTitleCase` | string helpers | — |
| `sleep` | `(ms: number) => Promise<void>` | — |
| `isDevelopment` / `isProduction` | `() => boolean` | env checks |

`lib/payment-utils.ts`: `calculatePaymentAmounts(total, type)`, `validatePaymentAmounts(type, total, online)` — see [§6.3](#63-payment-processing).

### 7.7 Validation Rules (`lib/validation.ts`)

| Validator | Rules | Returns |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| `validateEmail(email)` | non-empty, ≤ 254 chars, matches `^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$` | `{ valid, error? }` |
| `validatePassword(password)` | 6–128 chars | `{ valid, error? }` |
| `validateFullName(name)` | 2–100 chars; only `[a-zA-Z\s'-]`; ≥ 2 words | `{ valid, error? }` |
| `validatePhoneNumber(phone)` | exactly 10 digits after stripping non-digits | `{ valid, error? }` |

### 7.8 Error Handling

- **Client:** `react-hot-toast` for user-facing errors/success; form validation runs before API calls; API errors surface the `error` field.
- **Server:** every handler wrapped in `try/catch`; known failures return precise messages with the right status; unknown failures return generic `500`. (Sentry/Rollbar is a planned addition.)

### 7.9 Performance Notes

- Next.js `<Image>` for all images (auto WebP, lazy-loading); `next.config.js` allows arbitrary remote hosts because tour images are external URLs.
- Tailwind purges unused classes in production.
- GSAP timelines are scoped to component lifecycle.
- Lottie JSON loaded async.
- `supabaseAdmin` is module-cached.
- SEO pages are lightweight static content for good Core Web Vitals.

| `payments` | `payment_records` | 1 : N | `payment_records.payment_id` | one row per online/cash transaction |
| `bookings` | `payment_records` | 1 : N | `payment_records.booking_id` | denormalised text back-reference |
| `bookings` | `vehicle_assignments` | 1 : N | `vehicle_assignments.booking_id` | usually one; reassignment adds rows |
| `cars` | `vehicle_assignments` | 1 : N | `vehicle_assignments.car_id` | a car is used in many assignments over time |
| `destinations` | `bookings` | 1 : N | `bookings.destination_id` | **airport bookings only** — FROM Hollongi Airport TO this destination |
| `tour_packages` | `bookings` | 1 : N | `bookings.tour_package_id` | **tour bookings only** |
| `tour_packages` | `reviews` | 1 : N | polymorphic (`reviewable_type = 'tour'`) | |
| `bookings` | `reviews` | 1 : N | polymorphic (`reviewable_type = 'taxi_booking'`) | |
| `admins` | — | standalone | — | JWT-based admin auth, no FK to bookings |
| `app_settings` | — | standalone | — | key/value feature flags (e.g. `conflict_control_enabled`) |

## 11. Feature Reference

### 11.1 Airport Taxi Booking

- **Where:** `/book-taxi` (mode = airport).
- **Flow:** `contact → route → schedule → car → confirm`.
- **Direction:** always **FROM Hollongi Airport (Donyi Polo Airport)** TO a chosen destination. The source is fixed; customers pick their destination from the `destinations` list.
- **Inputs:** name, phone, email (locked if logged in); destination from `destinations` (carries `distance_km`, `estimated_duration_minutes`, `description`); date; time; passenger count.
- **Availability:** `GET /api/cars/available-models` with the computed `start`/`end`; only models with a free unit appear, each with `available_count`.
- **Pricing:** `destination.distance_km × car.per_km_charge`. No separate pricing table — the rate is stored on the `cars` row per car class. The confirm step shows the fare breakdown and payment split.
- **Constraints:** `passenger_count ≤ car.capacity`; conflict control (if ON) blocks overlapping commitments.
- **Output:** a `pending` booking → `/payment` (data passed via `sessionStorage.bookingData`).

### 11.2 Hourly Taxi Booking

- **Where:** `/book-taxi` (mode = hourly), and SEO entry `/hourly-taxi-itanagar`.
- **Flow:** `contact → details → schedule → car → confirm`.
- **Inputs:** name/phone/email; passenger count; date; start time; duration as **days + hours** (helper `formatDuration` renders e.g. `1d 4h`).
- **Pricing:** `no_of_hours × car.per_hr_charge`. Rate is stored on the `cars` row — no separate hourly-rates table.
- **Availability:** same overlap check over the full `[start, start+duration]` window.
- **Output:** `pending` booking → `/payment`.

### 11.3 Tour Package Booking

- **Where:** `/tours` (catalogue), `/tours/[id]/book`, `/tours/[id]/reviews`; category landings `/arunachal-tours`, `/itanagar-tours`.
- **Tour detail page:** name, description, `arrival_time`, `duration_hours`, `price`, `max_passengers`, `car_model`, `itinerary`, `highlights[]`, `image_url` + `image_urls[]` gallery, average rating & reviews (`fetchAllTourRatingStats`, `lib/reviews.ts`).
- **Booking:** select date & passengers (≤ `max_passengers`); availability is checked (tour vehicles are linked into the same conflict system); price is the fixed tour `price`.
- **Output:** `pending` booking with `tour_package_id` set → `/payment` (data via `sessionStorage.tourBookingData`, `type=tour`).

### 11.4 Payment System

- **Modes:** `partial` (30% online + 70% cash) and `full` (100% online).
- **Math:** advance `= round(total × 0.30 × 100)/100`; cash `= total − advance` (see `lib/payment-utils.ts`).
- **Gateway:** Razorpay hosted checkout; merchant name shown as **"Rina's Tours and Travels"**; amount in paise.
- **Server flow:** `POST /api/payment/create-order` → Razorpay order + `payments` row (`txn_status='pending'`); `POST /api/payment/verify` → HMAC check → `payments` (`success` + `payment_status`), `bookings` (`confirmed`), `payment_records` (+`invoice_number`), confirmation email.
- **Cash reconciliation:** admin → `POST /api/payment/confirm-cash` → sets `amount_cash_paid`, `cash_paid_at`, `cash_collected_by`.
- **Statuses:** `payments.payment_status ∈ {pending, partial, paid}`; `txn_status ∈ {pending, success, failed}`; `refund_status ∈ {none, pending, processed, failed}` (refunds are processed manually by an admin).
- **Helper library:** `lib/payment-db.ts` — `calculatePaymentAmounts`, `createPaymentInDB`, `getPaymentByBookingId`, `updatePaymentStatus`, `createPaymentRecord`, `getPaymentRecordsByPaymentId`, `markCashPaymentCollected`.
- **Test mode:** Razorpay test card `4111 1111 1111 1111` (any future expiry, any CVV); UPI `success@razorpay` / `failure@razorpay`.

### 11.5 Invoice System

- Client-side PDF (`lib/invoice.ts`, jsPDF + html2canvas) — no server round-trip.
- Contents: company header, invoice number, date, booking ID, customer block, service block, payment breakdown (online paid / cash due / total), footer.
- Available from Booking Confirmed and My Bookings; the invoice number originates from `payment_records.invoice_number` written at verification time.

### 11.6 Review System

- **Eligibility:** authenticated users; one review per `(user_email, reviewable_type, reviewable_id)` — DB unique index.
- **Data:** `reviewable_type ∈ {tour, taxi_booking}`, `rating` 1–5 (DB `CHECK`), optional `title`/`comment`, `is_visible` flag.
- **Display:** `components/ReviewCard.tsx` on tour pages; `components/ReviewForm.tsx` for submission; aggregate stats `{ avg, count, distribution{5..1} }` via `lib/reviews.ts` / `fetchAllTourRatingStats`.
- **Moderation:** admins toggle `is_visible`.
- **API:** `GET /api/reviews?reviewable_type=&reviewable_id=`, `POST /api/reviews`.

### 11.7 Email Notifications

- **Provider:** Resend (`lib/resend-notifications.ts`); SMTP via Nodemailer as fallback (`lib/notifications.ts`).
- **Events:** booking confirmation (on payment verify) → customer; vehicle assignment / reassignment → driver; cancellation processed → customer.
- **Note:** SMS & WhatsApp are placeholders (console-logged) — see TODOs.

### 11.8 Conflict Control System

- **Toggle:** `app_settings.conflict_control_enabled` (default ON).
- **ON:** booking creation and vehicle assignment reject overlaps (`existing.start < new.end AND existing.end > new.start`).
- **OFF:** manual management; the Misc-tab scanner (`GET /api/admin/conflicts`) lists **assignment conflicts** (same car, overlapping windows) and **model conflicts** (model over-subscribed in a window).
- **UX:** turning the toggle OFF shows a confirmation warning first.

### 11.9 SEO & Marketing Pages

| Route | Targets search intent |
|-------|-----------------------|
| `/hollongi-airport-taxi` | "Hollongi airport taxi" |
| `/donyi-polo-airport-taxi` | "Donyi Polo airport taxi" |
| `/itanagar-airport-taxi` | "Itanagar airport taxi" (legacy `/airport-taxi-itanagar` → 301 here) |
| `/hourly-taxi-itanagar` | "hourly taxi Itanagar" |
| `/arunachal-tours` | "Arunachal Pradesh tours" |
| `/itanagar-tours` | "Itanagar tours" |
| `/faq`, `/terms`, `/privacy` | informational / trust pages |

All use semantic HTML and the Next.js Metadata API; tour images may be arbitrary external URLs (allowed in `next.config.js`).

## 12. Admin Dashboard Reference

`app/admin/page.tsx` — wrapped in `ProtectedAdminPage`; tab state in `activeTab`; dark mode in `darkMode` (`localStorage.adminDarkMode`), applied via `data-admin-theme`. Tabs: **overview, bookings, car-management, destinations, tours, analytics, misc**. The Bookings tab badge shows the count of pending cancellations.

### 12.1 Overview Tab (`renderOverview`)
Stat cards: **Total Bookings**, **Total Revenue** (`Rs. {total}`), **Active Bookings**, **Completed Today**, **Pending Bookings** (filtered), **Cancelled Bookings** (filtered). Below: **Recent Bookings** list — each row links to a detail modal; desktop shows a 6-column grid (Booking ID, Customer, Type, Start Date, Amount, Status), mobile a stacked card.

### 12.2 Bookings Tab (`renderBookings`)
Full booking list with filters and the pending-cancellation badge. Per-booking actions: open details; **assign vehicle & driver** (`/api/bookings/assign-vehicle`, `/update-assignment`, `/get-assignments`); **update status** (`/api/bookings/update-status`); **confirm cash** (`/api/payment/confirm-cash`); **process cancellation** (`/api/admin/process-cancellation`). Hard-delete of a booking is also supported. Statuses revert to `confirmed` after a marked state is undone where applicable.

### 12.3 Cars Tab (`renderCarManagement`)
CRUD over `cars` (`GET/POST /api/cars`, `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/cars/[id]`): `model_name`, `class`, `capacity`, `number_plate`, `per_km_charge`, `per_hr_charge`, `is_active`. Adding a car runs a strict validation check (e.g. plate uniqueness, sane numbers). Active/inactive toggle controls availability listings.

### 12.4 Destinations Tab (`renderDestinations`)
CRUD over `destinations` (`GET/POST /api/destinations`, `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/destinations/[id]`): `name`, `distance_km`, `estimated_duration_minutes`, `description`, `is_active`. Distances are measured FROM Hollongi Airport. Distance and duration feed airport-fare calculation and ETAs shown to customers.

### 12.5 Tours Tab (`renderTours`)
CRUD over `tour_packages` (`GET/POST /api/tours`, `GET/PUT /api/tours/[id]`, `POST /api/tours/[id]/availability`, `POST /api/tours/upload-image`): `name`, `description`, `arrival_time`, `duration_hours`, `price`, `max_passengers`, `car_model`, `itinerary`, `highlights[]`, `image_url`, `image_urls[]` (multi-image), `is_active`. Tour vehicles are linked into the conflict system.

### 12.6 Analytics Tab (`renderAnalytics`)
- **Key metrics:** Total Revenue, Completed Bookings, Avg Booking Value, Fleet Utilization %.
- **Status overview:** booking status breakdown (pending / completed / cancelled / total), fleet info (total cars / destinations / active tours / total services), revenue breakdown (online collected / cash collected / total collected).
- **Weekly booking trend:** 7-day bar chart of bookings + revenue per day (`analytics.bookingTrend`).
- **Top destinations** (`analytics.topDestinations`) and **Top tours** (`analytics.topTours`, with revenue).
Backing data is computed into an `analytics` object: `totalRevenue`, `completedBookings`, `averageBookingValue`, `fleetUtilization`, `pendingBookings`, `cancelledBookings`, `totalPaid`, `totalCashCollected`, `bookingTrend[]`, `topDestinations[]`, `topTours[]`.

### 12.7 Misc Tab (`renderMisc`)
- **Settings:** dark-mode toggle; "Admin Panel Version v2.0"; "Last Updated" (today).
- **Documentation:** tag chips + **"Go to Docs"** button → `/admin/docs` (this document, rendered with live Mermaid diagrams).
- **Booking Conflict Control:** ON/OFF toggle (warns before disabling); conflict scanner (`GET /api/admin/conflicts`) listing assignment conflicts and model conflicts.
- **Pending Booking Management:** auto-cleanup ON/OFF; cleanup window 1–30 days; "run cleanup now"; current pending count.
- **Your Profile:** view/edit name & email; optional password change (`PUT /api/admin/update-profile`).
- **Admin Management:** add a new admin (`POST /api/admin/create-admin`).

### 12.8 Admin Authentication Quick Reference
- **Login page:** `/admin-login`. **Default credentials (change immediately):** `admin@rinastoursandtravels.in` / *(set at setup)*.
- **Architecture:** bcrypt hash → JWT (24 h) → `localStorage.adminToken`. Required env var: `JWT_SECRET` (generate with `openssl rand -base64 32`).
- **Key files:** `context/AdminContext.tsx`, `components/ProtectedAdminPage.tsx`, `scripts/generate-admin-hash.js`, `sql/admin_schema.sql`.
- **Admin SQL ops:**
```sql
-- add admin (hash first: node scripts/generate-admin-hash.js "pass")
INSERT INTO public.admins (email, password_hash, full_name, role, is_active)
VALUES ('admin@yourdomain.com', '$2b$10$...hash...', 'Admin Name', 'admin', true);
-- change password
UPDATE public.admins SET password_hash = '$2b$10$...newhash...' WHERE email = 'admin@yourdomain.com';
-- disable
UPDATE public.admins SET is_active = false WHERE email = 'admin@yourdomain.com';
-- login history
SELECT email, full_name, last_login, is_active FROM public.admins ORDER BY last_login DESC;
```
- Clear token in browser console: `localStorage.removeItem('adminToken')`.

## 13. API Documentation

**Base URL:** `http://localhost:3000` (dev) / `https://www.rinastoursandtravels.in` (prod).
**Auth:** customer routes rely on the Supabase session cookie; admin routes require `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>` (from `POST /api/admin/login`, 24 h expiry).
**Envelope:** `{ success: true, ... }` or `{ success: false, error }`; some reads return a named collection.

### 14.6 Database Setup
All 10 tables are in `sql/`. Run them in order in the Supabase SQL Editor (see `sql/README.md`):

1. `sql/cars_schema.sql` — `cars` table (vehicles + driver info, per-km/hr rates)
2. `sql/destinations_schema.sql` — `destinations` table (FROM-airport routes + distance)
3. `sql/tour_packages.sql` — `tour_packages` table (+ seed data)
4. `sql/bookings_and_payments_schema.sql` — `bookings`, `payments`, `payment_records` (+ enum types, constraints, alterations)
5. `sql/assignments_schema.sql` — `vehicle_assignments` table (booking ↔ car FK)
6. `sql/admin_schema.sql` — `admins` table (+ default admin, RLS, indexes)
7. `sql/reviews_schema.sql` — `reviews` table (polymorphic, + unique index)
8. `sql/app_settings_schema.sql` — `app_settings` table (+ seeds `conflict_control_enabled='true'`)

### 14.7 Admin Account Setup
```bash
node scripts/generate-admin-hash.js "YourStrongPassword"      # → $2b$10$...
# then in Supabase SQL Editor:
INSERT INTO public.admins (email, password_hash, full_name, role, is_active)
VALUES ('admin@yourdomain.com', '$2b$10$...', 'Admin Name', 'admin', true);
# set JWT_SECRET in .env.local:
openssl rand -base64 32
# log in at /admin-login
```

### 14.8 Payment Testing
| Method | Test value |
|--------|------------|
| Card | `4111 1111 1111 1111`, any future expiry, any CVV |
| UPI success | `success@razorpay` |
| UPI failure | `failure@razorpay` |
Switch to live by replacing `NEXT_PUBLIC_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID` (`rzp_live_…`) and `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET`.

### 14.9 Deployment (Vercel)
1. Push to GitHub → import at vercel.com → New Project.
2. Add all env vars under Settings → Environment Variables.
3. Deploy. Build: `npm run build`; install: `npm install`; region `iad1`; cron `0 0 * * *` → `/api/admin/cleanup-pending` (all in `vercel.json`).
4. Custom domain DNS: `A @ 76.76.19.165` and `CNAME www cname.vercel-dns.com`.
5. Rollback: Vercel → Deployments → pick a previous one → Promote to Production.

### 14.10 Coding Conventions
| Topic | Rule |
|-------|------|
| Booking ID | `generateBookingId()` — `BK` + timestamp suffix |
| Invoice number | `generateInvoiceNumber()` — written into `payment_records.invoice_number` at verify time |
| Currency | INR; display via `formatCurrency()`; Razorpay amounts in paise (× 100) |
| Dates | ISO 8601 UTC in DB; displayed in IST (UTC+5:30) via `date-fns` |
| Supabase clients | anon (`lib/supabase.ts`) for customer reads; service-role (`lib/supabase-admin.ts`) **server-only** for privileged writes |
| Validation | run `lib/validation.ts` before any submit |
| Tailwind | dark bg `bg-primary-950` (`#1a1512`); accent `bg-secondary-500` (`#ffda00`); `.btn-primary` / `.btn-secondary` / `.card` / `.input-field` |
| Security headers | set globally in `next.config.js` |

### 14.11 Debugging
Browser console (F12) · `npm run dev` terminal for server logs · Supabase dashboard (Table Editor / Logs) · DevTools Network tab · verify `.env.local` values. Test cards as above.

## 15. Glossary

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Booking** | A customer's order for a trip (airport, tour, or hourly). Identified by `booking_id`. |
| **Booking type** | `airport` \| `tour` \| `hourly`. |
| **Booking status** | `pending` → `confirmed` → `completed` \| `cancelled`. |
| **Payment type** | `partial` (30% online + 70% cash) or `full` (100% online). |
| **Payment status** | `pending` \| `partial` \| `paid`. |
| **Txn status** | Transaction state on the `payments` row: `pending` \| `success` \| `failed`. |
| **Refund status** | `none` \| `pending` \| `processed` \| `failed` (refunds are manual). |
| **Car model vs car** | Customers pick a *model* (name/class/capacity/price/available count); admins later assign a specific *car* (with number plate) and driver. |
| **Vehicle assignment** | A row linking a specific car + driver to a booking for a time window; basis of conflict detection. |
| **Conflict control** | The toggle (`app_settings.conflict_control_enabled`) that, when ON, blocks overlapping vehicle commitments. |
| **Overlap** | Two windows overlap iff `start_A < end_B AND end_A > start_B`. |
| **Advance / cash split** | Advance = `round(total × 0.30 × 100)/100`; cash = `total − advance`. |
| **Invoice number** | Generated at payment verification; stored on the `payment_records` row; rendered into the PDF. |
| **Cleanup cron** | Daily job (`/api/admin/cleanup-pending`, `0 0 * * *`) deleting stale `pending` bookings. |
| **Service role / anon client** | Two Supabase clients: anon (RLS-enforced, customer reads) and service role (bypasses RLS, server-side privileged writes). |
